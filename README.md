##  ** Build a Model to Classify Emails as Spam or not Spam **



* Build a model to classify emails as spam or not spam, we can use a machine learning approach. * We'll use a small, labeled dataset and the scikit-learn library in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

-  Load and Prepare the Dataset: We'll use a simple dataset with labeled emails.
-  Text Preprocessing: We'll clean and vectorize the text data.
-  Model Training: We'll use a machine learning model like Naive Bayes, which is well suited for text classification.
-  Model Evaluation: We'll evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and other metrics. Let's start by creating a small example dataset and implementing the model.
